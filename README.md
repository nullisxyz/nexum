## What is Nexum?

Nexum is a high-performance Ethereum provider written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, designed for both web extension environments and terminal interfaces. Originally forked from [frame-extension](https://github.com/frame-labs/frame-extension), Nexum is a fully compliant `EIP-1193` provider that brings together secure, fast, and hacker-friendly access to Ethereum.

With Nexum, users can connect to the Ethereum network through a unique setup that combines **WebTransport** with a **terminal-based** user interface wallet. This makes Nexum ideal for developers and hackers seeking a flexible, performant tool for interacting with Ethereum on the web and beyond.

## Goals

Nexum is built with the following goals:

1. **Compliance**: Nexum aims to be fully [`EIP-1193`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) and [`EIP-6963`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) compliant, ensuring seamless integration with Ethereum dApps and tools that rely on this standard provider API.
2. **Performance**: Built in Rust and compiled to WASM, Nexum ensures blazing-fast performance for both web and terminal access, with secure memory management and optimized response times.
3. **Web and Terminal Integration**: Nexum leverages [WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport) to provide a consistent and secure connection between the service worker and terminal interface, creating a powerful and seamless experience for web and terminal users alike.
4. **Hackable**: Nexum is designed for hackers, with a developer-first approach to Ethereum access. It supports flexible use in decentralized applications, testing environments, and experimental setups.

## Status

Nexum is currently in active development and intended for those looking to explore fast, `EIP-1193` compliant Ethereum access in a dual web/terminal environment. We invite developers and enthusiasts to contribute, test, and provide feedback as we expand Nexum's capabilities.
